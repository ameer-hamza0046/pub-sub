title:
publish-subscribe platform

plan of execution:
1. design of model
2. publish implementation, subscribe implementation
3. multi-subscribe implementation
4. push vs pull
5. testing and evaluation

planned project outputs:
1. publish model
2. subs model
3. multi-topic subs
4. correctness of pub sub model
5. experiment on high loads

Designs/Tradeoffs
1. push vs pull
2. memory vs disk
3. tcp vs udp
4. data format JSON vs binary
5. single topic vs multi-topic


Interesting:
pub-sub model design, real time communication

Challenging:
correctness of delivery, load balancing, 

Exploratory:
We will explore performance metrics in various design choices.


1. create a pub-sub model in a single file:
    input: already in main()
    output: to stdout
2.  input: stdin
    output: stdout
3.  input: client
    output: back to client
